# coreua111

This coreua111-class_notebooks folder contains Jupyter notebooks used during lectures.  

You can follow along and modify the notebooks (for example, you can add new code, your personal notes, new code/markdown cells, etc.).  The changes you  made will be saved.  If I updated my notebook "template", then your changes and my changes will be merged.  In particular, changes you made will be kept.

The folder shared/class_notebooks also contains Jupyter notebooks used during lectures. However, you cannot modify the notebooks in this folder.
